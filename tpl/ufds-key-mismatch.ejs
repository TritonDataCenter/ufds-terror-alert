Dear operator,

The UFDS Terror Alert System is no longer able to connect to UFDS, because
the SSL key fingerprint on the server does not match the one in its
configuration. If this is due to the UFDS server having been upgraded, please
correct the configuration.

Old fingerprint: <%= expectedFp %>
New fingerprint: <%= newFp %>
